[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /opt/ros/humble/share/ament_cmake_core/cmake/core/list_append_unique.cmake:30 (if):
  Policy CMP0057 is not set: Support new IN_LIST if() operator.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0057" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  IN_LIST will be interpreted as an operator when the policy is set to NEW.
  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used.
