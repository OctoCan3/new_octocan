[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtrac_ik_lib.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "trac_ik_lib", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "trac_ik_lib" with
  any of the following names:

    trac_ik_libConfig.cmake
    trac_ik_lib-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "trac_ik_lib" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "trac_ik_lib_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "trac_ik_lib" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
